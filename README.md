# Zuri

All the projects here were all done in fulfilment of my training with ZURI.

Some tasks were done multiple times on a personal note in order to perfect what has been done before or practice again without cheatsheets or other like materials.

The tasks show a progression from basic to intermediate representing evidence of my growth in a short period and how I am able to progress with the right environment and motivation to learn and work.
